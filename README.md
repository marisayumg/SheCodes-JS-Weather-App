A weather app built using vanilla javascript. This was my final project created for the SheCodes Plus course. It uses live data from Open Weather Map API to fetch weather details, current and 5 day forecast, 


## Requirements

This weather app needs the following features:

1. Search for a city (from Open Weather Map API);
2. Get weather details for that city such as temperature, weather description, humidity level and wind speed;
3. Option to see the temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit units;
4. Get the weather forecast for the next 5 days;
