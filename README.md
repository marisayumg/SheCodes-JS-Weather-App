## Vanilla Javascript Weather App

See this project [live here](https://myg-js-weather-app.netlify.app).


## Description

A weather app built using vanilla javascript. This was my final project created for the SheCodes Plus course. It uses live data from Open Weather Map API to fetch weather details for current day and 5-day forecast.


## Requirements

This weather app has the following features:

1. Search for a city (from Open Weather Map API);
2. Get weather details for that city such as temperature, weather description, humidity level and wind speed;
3. Get the weather forecast for the next 5 days;
4. Be fully responsive;
5. Creative feature: background changes colour depending on weather condition for that location.
