## Description

A weather app built using vanilla javascript. This was my final project created for the SheCodes Plus course.


## Requirements

This weather app needs the following features:

1. Search for a city (from Open Weather Map API);
2. Get weather details for that city such as temperature, weather description, humidity level and wind speed;
3. Option to see the temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit units;
4. Get the weather forecast for the next 5 days;
